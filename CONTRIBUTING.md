## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Prefer functional programming patterns

### Testing

- Write comprehensive tests for all new features
- Maintain 100% code coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks

### Documentation

- Update README.md for any API changes
- Add code examples for new features
- Use clear, concise language
- Include TypeScript type definitions

## Performance Guidelines

- All functions should maintain O(n) complexity or better
- Benchmark new features against existing implementations
- Avoid unnecessary object creation in hot paths
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection impact

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```text
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `perf`: Performance improvements

Examples:

```text
feat(pickit): add deep path support with dot notation
fix(mergeit): handle null values in deep merge
docs(readme): update examples for transformit function
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a pull request
4. After merge, tag the release
5. Publish to npm
